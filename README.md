# Bandit-algorithm-in-stock-selection
Use bandit algorithm to train an agent that can do investment like human being

## Problem setting
View the stock recommendation as an interactive recommendation problem because the goal is to maximize the total reward over a long sequence of stock operations.

## The question is
1. How do we track the performance of the stock?
2. How do we define the reward of a recommending stock based on its feedback?
3. Which bandit algorithm should we use to achieve the maximum reward in the long run?

## Strategy
- Epsilon greedy
- Upper Confidence Bounds (UCB)
- Contextual bandits

## Goal
Train your algo to maximum long-term rewards
